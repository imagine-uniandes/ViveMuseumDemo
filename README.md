# ViveMuseumDemo - Museo Confucio

ViveMuseumDemo is a simple VR demo of a museum created to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the Confucio Institute at the University of the Andes, Bogota, Colombia. Users can move and interact in the environment as if they were in an actual museum. Each room features different photos depicting the history of the institute and other images related to Chinese culture. There is also a curated collection of artifacts and historical objects. By simply approaching and gazing at an object, detailed information about them appears. The application also implements a navigation technique based on teleporting interaction, where users only need to point to the floor at the intended spot, and the player is immediately teleported. This demo is a good starting point to develop more elaborate interactive VR museums that offer a rich, immersive experience blending education with beauty or tradition.
